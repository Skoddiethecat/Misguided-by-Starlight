\subsubsection{Academics}
Academics is a broad-based Skill that represents a character's degree of higher education and general knowledge
in the Arts and Humanities --- everything from English to history, economics to law. Dots in this Skill do not directly correlate to a given level of education. Your character could have entered a doctorate program but spent more time partying than studying, resulting in low dots. Conversely, a self-taught individual who read voraciously and studied intensively could have high dots without
ever earning a diploma.
