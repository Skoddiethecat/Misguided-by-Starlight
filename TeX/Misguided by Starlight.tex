\section{Practical Skill Advancement}
When the game begins you will be given a Practical Skill Advancement Worksheet for recording successful and failed checks on skill rolls. When you have accumulated a number of successes and failures equal to your current skill level +1 you may gain a free dot in that skill.

\section{Noms}
At the end of each chapter each player and the GM may nominate another player for exemplary roleplay. These may be spent during play to reroll one failed die or lower the explode threshold on a single die.
Improving on 10-again
- Any effect which improves the 10-again mechanic behaves as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rolls without 10-again regain 10-again
	\item 10-again becomes 9-again
	\item 9-again becomes 8-again
	\item These effects stack
	\item No roll may be reduced below 8-again
\end{itemize}

\section{Experience}
All traits have flat costs:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Attribute 15 exp
	\item PSA Point 3 exp
	\item Skill Specialty 3 exp
	\item Merit 6 exp
	\item Willpower 8 exp (restore spent dot)
\end{itemize}
The fifth dot of a trait does not cost double at creation.
